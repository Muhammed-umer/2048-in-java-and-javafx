# 2048 Game in Java

A simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using Java and JavaFX. This project is designed to help users learn about game development concepts, grid-based layouts, and GUI integration with JavaFX.

## 🎮 Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Use arrow keys to play the game.
- **Dynamic Grid Updates**: The 4x4 grid dynamically updates as you play.
- **Color-Coded Tiles**: Tiles are color-coded based on their values for better visualization.
- **Random Tile Generation**: New tiles (2 or 4) are randomly added to empty spaces.
- **Game Over Detection**: Alerts the player when no more moves are possible.
- **Modern UI Design**: Clean and visually appealing layout using JavaFX.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core logic and backend implementation.
- **JavaFX**: GUI for the game grid and event handling.
- **Random Class**: For random tile generation.

## 📋 How to Play
1. Use the **Arrow Keys** on your keyboard:
   - **Up**: Combine and move tiles upward.
   - **Down**: Combine and move tiles downward.
   - **Left**: Combine and move tiles to the left.
   - **Right**: Combine and move tiles to the right.
2. When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one with their sum.
3. The goal is to achieve a tile with the value **2048**. You can continue playing even after reaching 2048 for a high score.
